# Concurrency Playground in Golang

Welcome to the Concurrency Playground repository! ðŸš€ This collection of Golang projects explores various aspects of concurrent programming, offering hands-on examples and implementations.

## Projects

1. **[Bounded Blocking Queue](boundedblockingqueue/README.md)**
   - A thread-safe, bounded blocking queue implementation for managing tasks in a concurrent environment. (**Difficulty:** Medium)
   - [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-bounded-blocking-queue/)
2. **[Rides](rides/README.md)**
   - Simulates a scenario where Democrats and Republicans order Uber rides, considering specific conditions to prevent conflicts. (**Difficulty:** Hard)
3. **[BuildingH2O](buildingh2o/README.md)**
   - Demonstrates concurrent molecule creation using Go routines and synchronization primitives, simulating the formation of water molecules (H2O). (**Difficulty:** Medium)
   - [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/building-h2o/)
4. **[Dining Philosophers](diningphilosopher/README.md)**
   - Implements the classic Dining Philosophers problem using Go concurrency features, exploring synchronization techniques for resource sharing. (**Difficulty:** Medium)
   - [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/)
