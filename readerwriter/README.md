## Go Package for Structured Read/Write Access with WaitGroup and Channels

This package, `readerwriter`, provides a `ReaderWriter` interface structured concurrent read and write access to a shared data element. It utilizes a `sync.RWMutex` for thread safety and channels for synchronization between readers and writers.

## Functionality

1. **`ReaderWriter` Interface:**
   - Defines two methods:
      - `Read() interface{}`: This method allows reading the current data value. It doesn't take any arguments.
      - `Write(data interface{})`: This method allows writing a new value to the shared data. It takes the data to be written as an argument.

2. **`readerWriter` Struct:**
   - `mutex`: A `sync.RWMutex` object is used to manage concurrent read and write access to the shared data.
   - `data`: This field stores the actual data element that can be read or written.
   - `ch`: An optional channel can be provided for additional synchronization between methods (not used in this implementation).
   - `wg`: An optional `sync.WaitGroup` can be provided to track completion of read/write operations (used in this implementation).
   - `rCh`: A channel specifically for reader synchronization (optional).
   - `wCh`: A channel specifically for writer synchronization (optional).

3. **`Read` Method:**
   - Signals completion within the provided `wg`.
   - Acquires a read lock on the `mutex`.
   - Sends a signal (1) through the `rCh` channel (optional for reader synchronization).
   - Reads the current value of the `data` field.
   - Sends another signal (-1) through the `rCh` channel (optional for reader synchronization).
   - Releases the read lock on the `mutex`.
   - Returns the read value.

4. **`Write` Method:**
   - Signals completion within the provided `wg` (if provided).
   - Acquires a write lock on the `mutex`.
   - Sends a signal (1) through the `wCh` channel (optional for writer synchronization).
   - Updates the `data` field with the provided data.
   - Sends another signal (-1) through the `wCh` channel (optional for writer synchronization).
   - Releases the write lock on the mutex.

5. **`NewReaderWriter` Function:**
   - Takes an initial data value, an optional `sync.WaitGroup`, and optional channels for reader (`rCh`) and writer (`wCh`) synchronization as arguments.
   - Creates a new `readerWriter` instance with the provided parameters and returns it as a `ReaderWriter` interface.

## Usage

1. Import the `readerwriter` package in your Go program.
2. Create a `sync.WaitGroup` (optional) for tracking completion of read/write operations if needed.
3. Create optional channels for reader (`rCh`) and writer (`wCh`) synchronization if needed (implementation in this code is for demonstration purposes only).
4. Use the `NewReaderWriter` function to create a new `ReaderWriter` instance with the desired initial data value, optional `WaitGroup`, and optional channels.
5. Call the `Read` method to concurrently read the data from multiple goroutines. Utilize the provided channels (`rCh` for demonstration) for synchronization if needed.
6. Call the `Write` method to update the shared data from a single goroutine at a time. Utilize the provided channels (`wCh` for demonstration) for synchronization if needed.

This package provides a more structured approach to managing concurrent read/write access with thread safety and synchronization options using channels.

## Considerations

- The provided channels (`rCh` and `wCh`) in this implementation are for demonstration purposes only and not used internally within the methods. You can adapt their usage for your specific synchronization needs.
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented here. You can extend the code to handle potential errors.
